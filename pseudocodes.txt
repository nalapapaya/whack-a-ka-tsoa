Pseudocode
----------

1. Initialize the game:
    - ask for player's name
    - show difficulty options: easy, hard, god mode
    - set default values:
        - selectedDifficulty
        - selectedWeapon
        - resultMessage: 
        ----
        easy
        ----
            a. if before appearance ('Too early')
            b. if after appearance & missed ('The ka-tsoa got you!')
            c. on hit ('Ka-tsoa eliminated!' or 'ATOH!')
        ----
        hard
        ----
            a. end of timeRange ('You elimiated (amount) ka-tsoa today!')

        - score = 0 (hard)

2. Define constants:
    - weaponOptions = ["slippers", "newspapers", "bug spray"] - preferably 2 options
        targetRange: {large, medium, small}
    - difficultySettings =
        easy: { delayRange: 1000–3000ms, holes: 1 }
        hard: { delayRange: 0–60000ms, holes: 3 }
        god: { delayRange: 0ms, stayOnPage: true } or { autoWhack: true } - for demo or tutorial

3. When player clicks "Start Game" or "May the odds be in your Favour":
    - Show selected difficulty and weapon
    - Hide cockroach at start
    - Display “Get Ready…” or "Hold Your Breath.." message
    - Start randomTimer (based on difficulty)
    - After timer ends, show cockroach randomly from one of the holes

4. Handle player’s whack attempt:
    -----
    easy
    -----
    - If cockroach has NOT appeared yet:
        - Show “Too early!” message
        - Reset game
    - If cockroach has appeared:
        - Calculate reaction time
        - Show "Ka-tsoa eliminated" or “ATOH!” message with time
        - Save score if it's higher than current highscore
    -----
    hard
    -----
    - If hit when cockroach has NOT appeared yet:
        - Negative score
    - If hit AFTER first appearance:
        - Add score per hit
        - Subtract score when missed
        - Save score if it's higher than current highscore
        - Show leaderboard highscore
    - Play again button when countDown = 0

6. Handle God Mode:
    - Allow cockroach to stay no page for hitting anytime
    or
    - Auto-whack after short delay to demo winning state

7. On “Reset” button click:
    - Clear all messages
    - Reset variables to initial state
    - Hide cockroach
    - Reset timer and current score
